###  Arduino 
<img src = "/Hardware/Arduino.jpg" alt="Little Micro Controller">
<p> This is a microcontroller where it runs one program at a time. It is kind of like a rasberry pi but with less power and functionality. As it is a simple computer, you can write C++ software on it to perform a function. It takes some sort of input, and outputs something based on that code. In my case, it will detect movement from my dogs and output a muscial sound.
