## Welcome

<p> As with having 3 dogs in my house equates to a lot of maintenance. One thing I try not to do is to accidently hurt them. When I am working on assignments in my house, I leave my door open where my dogs come in. When they do come, I do not hear them at all as I am listening to my professor or music during work. 
</p>

<p> Once I complete an assignment or get off my chair, I accidently hit them with my feet or the chair rolls on their little paws. I could just shut my door, but then my parents would yell (typical Asian household) at me for something.
</p>

<p> To solve this issue, I will use a bit of code and a bit of hardware. You can click down on each markdown to learn more â¬‡
