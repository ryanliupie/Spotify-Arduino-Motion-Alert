## Welcome

<p> As with having 3 dogs in my house equates to a lot of maintenance. One thing I try not to do is accidently hurting them. When I am working on assignments in my house, I leave my door open where my dogs come in. When they do come, I do not hear them at all as I am listening listening to my professor or simply music during work. 
</p>

<p> Once I complete an assignment or simply get off my chair, I accidently hit them with my feet or the chair rolls on their little paws. I simply could just shut my door, but then my parents would yell (typical Asian household) at me for something.

<p> To solve this issue, I will use a bit of code and a bit of hardware. You can click down on each markdown to learn more â¬‡ </p>
